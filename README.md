MORTAL PONGBAT!!!!!! (Table Tennis Bracket Generator)
Welcome to my app, built for the DevelopMe coding bottcamp technical challenge.

This web app is designed to allow a user to create a list of players for their table tennis tournament and then generate a tournament bracket using those players.

The app allows you to select the winner of each match and progress those winners into the next round until the champion is decided in the final.

This is a sudden death Tournament, I have set the possible player amounts to 4, 8, 16, 32 & 64.

A live version of the app can be found here - http://ricky.developme.space/
